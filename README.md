## 3. Defined Approach

The aim of this experiment is to design and develop a responsive admin dashboard using modern web technologies. The dashboard layout is created using **CSS Grid**, which allows structured placement of the sidebar, header, and main content area in a clean and scalable manner.

The user interface is built using **HTML5** for page structure and **CSS3** for styling. CSS variables are defined to manage colors and themes efficiently. A `data-theme` attribute is applied at the root level to enable smooth switching between light and dark themes.

Dynamic theme switching is implemented using **JavaScript**. A toggle button is provided in the dashboard header, allowing users to switch themes interactively. The selected theme is stored in the browser’s **localStorage**, ensuring persistence of user preference even after refreshing the page.

Responsive design is achieved using media queries, where the sidebar automatically hides on smaller screen sizes to improve usability on mobile devices.
