## 3. Defined Approach

The aim of this experiment is to design and develop a responsive admin dashboard using modern web technologies. The dashboard layout is created using **CSS Grid**, which allows structured placement of the sidebar, header, and main content area in a clean and scalable manner.

The user interface is built with **HTML5** for structure and **CSS3** for styling. CSS variables are used to define color schemes for both light and dark themes. A `data-theme` attribute is applied at the root level to switch between themes efficiently.

Dynamic theme switching is implemented using **JavaScript**. A toggle button is provided in the dashboard header, enabling users to switch between light and dark modes. The selected theme is stored in the browser’s **localStorage**, ensuring that the preference is retained even after refreshing the page.

Responsive design is handled using media queries, where the sidebar is hidden on smaller screens to enhance usability on mobile devices.

This approach ensures a clean design, better user experience, and practical implementation of CSS Grid and dynamic theme handling.
